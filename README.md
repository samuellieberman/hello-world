# hello-world
the classic first time project

Hello!  My name is Sam!  I'm a CS student at Boise State and I'm loving it.  I have done something like 80 projects in javascript which are posted on Khan Academy and I have done a couple more projects in java which are stored on my own machine.  I intend to post my java projects on this account, but I don't know when I will get around to that.
